# Historical Childbirth Mortality Analysis (Handwashing Death Rate)

## Project Overview
This analysis explores historical birth and mortality data from Vienna General Hospital in the 1840s, inspired by the work of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis. The aim is to understand trends in maternal death rates and compare births vs deaths to generate insights on health outcomes.

## Dataset
- `annual_deaths_by_clinic.csv`: yearly births, deaths and locations
- `monthly_deaths.csv`: monthly birth and death records with time data

## Tools and Techniques
- Python (pandas, numpy) for data cleaning and transformation  
- Data visualization with matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and descriptive statistics

## Key Insights
- Summary of trends observed (e.g., changes in mortality rates over time)
- Visual illustrations of births vs deaths
